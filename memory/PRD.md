# StartupOps - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build "StartupOps" - a unified digital platform that acts as an operational workspace for early-stage founders. Part of IIT Jammu Techpreneur (Udyamotsav '26) competition.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI + @supabase/supabase-js
- **Backend**: FastAPI + MongoDB + supabase-py (auth verification) + emergentintegrations (Gemini AI)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (Google OAuth + Email/Password)
- **Database**: MongoDB for app data, Supabase for auth
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via emergentintegrations library

## User Personas
1. **Founder**: Full access - creates startup, manages team, views analytics, generates pitch
2. **Team Member**: Limited access - assigned tasks, milestones, feedback submission

## Core Requirements (Mandatory Modules)
1. Authentication & Authorization (Supabase Auth + role-based access)
2. Startup Profile & Workspace (CRUD, editable, scalable)
3. Task & Milestone Tracking (Kanban board, milestones, progress)
4. Feedback & Validation System (categories, ratings, internal/external)
5. Analytics Dashboard (task trends, milestone progress, charts)

## Bonus Features
1. AI-Based Insights (Gemini - general, tasks, milestones, growth)
2. Investor Pitch Generator (AI-powered pitch outlines)
3. Mock Payment Integration (Free/Pro/Scale plans)
4. Cloud Deployment (live hosted application)
